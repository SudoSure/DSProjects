    "* Like the lab, your coding work will be developed in the accompanying `project.py` file, that will be imported into the current notebook. This code will be autograded.\n",

    "* **For the Checkpoint, which is required, you only need to turn in a `project.py` containing solutions for Questions 1-4!**\n",
    "    - The \"Project 1 Checkpoint\" autograder on Gradescope does not thoroughly check your code ‚Äì it only runs the public tests on Questions 1-4 to make sure that you have completed them. There are no hidden tests for the checkpoint, and you will see your score upon submission. \n",
    "    - When you submit the final version of the project, however, we will use hidden tests to check your answers more thoroughly.\n",
    "    - Note that this means you will ultimately have to submit the project twice ‚Äì once to the \"Project 1 Checkpoint\" autograder (Questions 1-4 only), and once to the \"Project 1\" autograder (once you're fully done).\n",
    "- **Do not change the function names in the `project.py` file!** The functions in the `project.py` file are how your assignment is graded, and they are graded by their name. If you changed something you weren't supposed to, you can find the original code in the [course GitHub repository](https://github.com/dsc-courses/dsc80-2023-wi).\n",
    "- **To ensure that all of your work to be submitted is in `project.py`, we've provided an additional uneditable notebook, called `project-validation.ipynb`, that contains only the tests and their setup. Make sure you are able to run it top-to-bottom without error before submitting!**\n",

You are encouraged to follow the pair programming model, in which you work on just a single computer and alternate who writes the code and who thinks about the problems at a high level.\n",

    "### Putting Everything Together\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few remarks and tips for approaching Project 1, and projects more generally:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you are having trouble figuring out what a question is asking you to do, look at the big picture and try to understand what the current step is doing to contribute to this big picture. This may clarify what's being asked!\n",
    "1. These questions intentionally build off of each other and the final result matters! In fact, you can \"get a question correct\", but only receive partial credit for it because a previous answer was wrong.\n",
    "    - Credit for a question will typically receive partial credit based on *how close* your answer is to correct (as well as some credit for a solution in the correct form). \n",
    "    - You should try to assess your answer to each question based on what you understand of the data. This might involve writing extensive code (that isn't turned in) just to check your work! Suggestions on checking your work are given in the assignment, but you should also think of your own ways of checking your work.\n",
    "    - As you do this project, think about the data from the perspective of the student (which should be easy to do, since you've used Gradescope before!)\n",
    "1. To test the correctness of your answers:\n",
    "     - Once you have implemented a particular function in `project.py`, you should test out your function in the notebook. In particular, you should inspect/analyze the output to assess its correctness.\n",
    "    - Run your functions on the main dataset (`grades`) and ask yourself if the output *looks correct.*\n",
    "    - Run your functions on very small datasets (e.g. 1-5 row DataFrames that you construct by hand), calculate the expected output by hand, and see if the function output matches (this *is* unit-testing your code with data).\n",
    "    * Run your functions on (large and small) samples of the dataset `grades`. Does your code break, or does it still run as expected?"

    "## Part 5: Time for Redemption üôè\n",
    "\n",
    "The syllabus we've used so far was put together by Professor Weiyue, who has taught CSD 18 for several iterations. This was Professor Praveen's first time teaching CSD 18, and towards the end of the quarter he proposed a new idea to reward students for showing an improvement in their understanding of the earlier ideas in the course on the final exam. Specifically, here's what he proposed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The instructors will identify the questions on the final exam that contain content that was also covered on the midterm exam. Call these \"redemption questions.\"\n",
    "- For each student, compute their \"raw redemption score\", which is the proportion of points available on redemption questions that they earned. If they did not take the final exam, their raw redemption score is 0.\n",
    "- Convert the class' raw redemption scores to z-scores, i.e. to standard units.\n",
    "- Convert the class' original midterm exam grades, as proportions, to z-scores.\n",
    "- If a student's raw redemption z-score is higher than their original midterm exam z-score, replace their original midterm exam score with one that has a z-score equal to their raw redemption z-score. This is done by converting their raw redemption z-score back to a midterm grade proportion using the standard deviation and mean of the midterm exam.\n",
    "- If not, leave their original midterm exam score as-is. **Note that this policy can only increase a student's midterm exam score (and, hence, their total course grade), not decrease!**\n",
    "\n",
    "As a refresher from [DSC 10](https://dsc-courses.github.io/dsc10-2022-fa/resources/lectures/lec21/lec21.html#Standard-units), to convert a sequence of numbers to z-scores, or standard units, we use the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z(x_i) = \\frac{x_i - \\text{mean of } x}{\\text{SD of }x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this redemption policy, let's look at a concrete example.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Suppose the final exam was worth 80 points. 55 of these points came from Questions 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9, which were the redemption questions. The class' mean score on just the redemption questions was 0.8, with a standard deviation of 0.15.\n",
    "- Suppose the midterm exam was worth 70 points. The class' mean score on the midterm exam was 0.6, with a standard deviation of 0.25.\n",
    "- Yuxin, a student in the course, earned a $\\frac{74}{80}$ on the final exam, including a $\\frac{51}{55}$ on the redemption questions, and a $\\frac{53}{70}$ on the midterm exam. Then:\n",
    "    - Her raw redemption score is $\\frac{51}{55}$, and her redemption z-score is $\\frac{\\frac{51}{55} - 0.8}{0.15} \\approx 0.8485$.\n",

    "Complete the implementation of the function `z_score`, which takes in a Series of numbers and returns a Series in which all elements are converted to z-scores. As a reminder, to convert a sequence of numbers to z-scores, or standard units, we use the following formula:\n",

    "- Make sure to set the `ddof=0` in whichever method or function you use to compute standard deviation. `numpy` and `pandas` both use different default denominators when computing standard deviation. (`ddof=0` computes the \"population\" standard deviation and `ddof=1` computes the \"sample\" standard deviation.)\n",
    "- Do **not** fill null values ‚Äì that is, if a value in the input Series is `NaN`, its value in the output Series should also be `NaN`. (Depending on how you implement `z_score`, this may happen automatically.)\n",

    "You can use your `z_score` function to compute the z-scores of each student's original midterm exam grades and raw redemption scores. Note that there are students who didn't take the midterm, who need to have their `NaN` scores fixed *prior to calculating their z-scores* (or else you will end up with `NaN` z-scores which does not represent 0 in this case).
